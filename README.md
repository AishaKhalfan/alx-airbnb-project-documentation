## Task 0. Documenting Project Features and Functionalities

**Objective:** Identify and document the key features and functionalities of the Airbnb Clone project.

**Instructions:**

*   Review the project requirements for the Airbnb Clone backend [here](https://savanna.alxafrica.com/rltoken/CN5nWELM11lIIvusZnWx3g).
    
*   Using [Draw.io](https://savanna.alxafrica.com/rltoken/C9c1zKT6CST6FiUa6r6jUg), create a detailed document that lists all the features and functionalities the backend needs to support. This should include user authentication, property management, booking system, and payments.
    
*   Export your design as a PNG file and store it in a directory called features-and-functionalities/ within your GitHub repository alx-airbnb-project-documentation.
    
*   Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository.
    

**Repo:**

*   GitHub repository: alx-airbnb-project-documentation
    
*   Directory: features-and-functionalities/
    
*   File: README.md
    

## Task 1. Design the Use Case Diagram of the Features and Functionalities

**Objective**: Visualize system interactions using a use case diagram.

**Instructions:**

*   Based on the features outlined in Task 1, use Draw.io to create a use case diagram that visualizes the interactions between users and the system for key functionalities like user registration, property booking, and payments.
    
*   Ensure that all key actors and interactions are captured in the diagram.
    
*   Export your diagram as a PNG file and store it in a directory called use-case-diagram/ within your GitHub repository alx-airbnb-project-documentation.
    
*   Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository.
    

**Repo:**

*   GitHub repository: alx-airbnb-project-documentation
    
*   Directory: use-case-diagram/
    
*   File: README.md

## Task  2. Convert Your Use Case Diagram to User Stories

**Objective:** Translate use case diagram interactions into user stories.

**Instructions:**

*   Using the use case diagram from Task 1, convert each use case into a relevant user story. Example: “As a user, I want to be able to register an account so that I can list my properties.”
    
*   Write at least 5 user stories that capture the core interactions from the use case diagram.
    
*   Create a file named user-stories.md in the directory user-stories/ within your GitHub repository alx-airbnb-project-documentation and document your user stories there.
    
*   Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository
    

**Repo:**

*   GitHub repository: alx-airbnb-project-documentation
    
*   Directory: user-stories/
    
*   File: user-stories.md,README.md
    

## Task 3. Design a Data Flow Diagram for Your Features and Functionalities

**Objective:** Create a data flow diagram (DFD) to map the data flow within the system.

**Instructions:**

*   Based on the features and functionalities identified in Task 1, design a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) using Draw.io that illustrates how data moves through the system. Include key entities like users, properties, bookings, and payments.
    
*   The DFD should cover data inputs, processes, and outputs for core backend operations.
    
*   Export your diagram as a PNG file as data-flow.png and store it in a directory called data-flow-diagram/ within your GitHub repository alx-airbnb-project-documentation.
    
*   Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository.
    

**Repo:**

*   GitHub repository: alx-airbnb-project-documentation
    
*   Directory: data-flow-diagram/
    

## Task 4. Design a Flowchart for System Processes

**Objective:** Map the workflow and processes of the backend features.

**Instructions:**

*   Choose one of the key **backend** processes (e.g., user registration, property booking) and design a flowchart in Draw.io to visualize the steps and data flow for this process.
    
*   Export the flowchart as a PNG and store it in the flowcharts directory under the alx-airbnb-project-documentation GitHub repository.
    
*   Commit and push the changes to your repository.
    

**Repo:**

*   GitHub repository: alx-airbnb-project-documentation
    
*   Directory: flowcharts/
    
*   File: data-flow-diagram.png
    

## Task 5. Write Requirement Specifications for Backend Features

**Objective:** Document the technical and functional requirements for each feature.

**Instructions:**

*   Write detailed requirement specifications for at least three key backend features from Task 1 (e.g., User Authentication, Property Management, Booking System).
    
*   Include API endpoints, input/output specifications, validation rules, and performance criteria.
    
    *   Document this in a requirements.md file and store it in the root directory of the alx-airbnb-project-documentation GitHub repository.
        
*   Commit and push the changes to your repository.
    

**Repo:**

*   GitHub repository: alx-airbnb-project-documentation
    
*   File: requirements.md
    

## Task 6. Manual Review

**Repo:**

*   GitHub repository: alx-airbnb-project-documentation
    
*   Directory: features-and-functionalities,use-case-diagram, user-stories, data-flow-diagram, flowcharts,
