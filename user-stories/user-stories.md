**Objective:** Translate use case diagram interactions into user stories.

**Instructions:**

*   Using the use case diagram from Task 1, convert each use case into a relevant user story. Example: “As a user, I want to be able to register an account so that I can list my properties.”
    
*   Write at least 5 user stories that capture the core interactions from the use case diagram.
    
*   Create a file named user-stories.md in the directory user-stories/ within your GitHub repository alx-airbnb-project-documentation and document your user stories there.
    
*   Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository
